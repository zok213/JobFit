This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Python API Server (For Roadmap Generation)

To use the roadmap generation feature which connects to Jina AI API, you need to run the Python backend:

```bash
# Navigate to Backend directory
cd Backend

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the API server
python run_simple_server.py
```

The Python API server will run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and will handle requests from the frontend to communicate with Jina AI API.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
